[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Starts a deployment for a manually deployed app. Manually deployed apps
       are not connected to a Git repository.

       The maximum duration between the [1mCreateDeployment [22mcall and the [1mStartDe-[0m
       [1mployment  [22mcall  cannot exceed 8 hours. If the duration exceeds 8 hours,
       the [1mStartDeployment [22mcall and the associated [1mJob [22mwill fail.

          [1mployment  [22mwithout [1mCreateDeployment [22m. The source URL can be either an
          HTTP GET URL that is publicly accessible and downloads a single .zip
          file, or an Amazon S3 bucket and prefix.

          +o max: [1m3000[0m

          +o pattern: [1m^(s3|https|http)://.*[0m

       [1m--source-url-type [22m(string)
          The type of source specified by the [1msourceURL [22m. If the value is  [1mZIP[0m
          ,  the  source  is  a .zip file. If the value is [1mBUCKET_PREFIX [22m, the
          source is an Amazon S3 bucket and prefix. If no value is  specified,
          the default is [1mZIP [22m.

          Possible values:

          +o [1mBUCKET_PREFIX[0m

       [1m--cli-input-json  [22m|  [1m--cli-input-yaml [22m(string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       [1m--generate-cli-skeleton[22m. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with [1m--cli-input-yaml[22m.

       [1m--generate-cli-skeleton  [22m(string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value [1minput[22m, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for [1m--cli-input-json[22m. Similarly, if provided [1myaml-input [22mit will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with [1m--cli-input-yaml[22m.  If  provided
       with  the  value  [1moutput[22m, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not
       stable between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards  com-
       patibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

[1mGLOBAL OPTIONS[0m
       [1m--debug [22m(boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       [1m--endpoint-url [22m(string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       [1m--no-verify-ssl [22m(boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       [1m--no-paginate [22m(boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       [1m--output [22m(string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       +o yaml

       +o yaml-stream

       [1m--query [22m(string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       [1m--profile [22m(string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       [1m--region [22m(string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       [1m--version [22m(string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       Turn on/off color output.

       +o auto

       [1m--no-sign-request [22m(boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       [1m--ca-bundle [22m(string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       [1m--cli-read-timeout [22m(int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       [1m--cli-connect-timeout [22m(int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

       [1m--cli-binary-format [22m(string)

       The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is
       base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs  to  be  provided  as  a
       base64  encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compati-
       bility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed liter-
       ally. When providing contents from a file that map  to  a  binary  blob
       [1mfileb:// [22mwill always be treated as binary and use the file contents di-
       rectly  regardless of the [1mcli-binary-format [22msetting. When using [1mfile://[0m
       the file contents will need to properly formatted  for  the  configured
       [1mcli-binary-format[22m.

       Automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.

       [1m--no-cli-auto-prompt [22m(boolean)

       Disable automatically prompt for CLI input parameters.
