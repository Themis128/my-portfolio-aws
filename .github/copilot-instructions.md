# Copilot workspace instructions

Use this file to communicate short, workspace-specific goals and actions that Copilot should help with.

## Checklist

- [x] Verify that the `copilot-instructions.md` file in the `.github` directory exists.
- [x] Clarify project requirements — add a short summary to `README.md`.
- [x] Scaffold the project — ensure `src/`, `tests/`, and `package.json` have basic content and scripts.
- [x] Customize the project — include recommended editor settings and `editorconfig`.
- [x] Install required extensions — list recommended VS Code extensions in `.vscode/extensions.json`.
- [x] Compile the project — confirm `npm run build` succeeds locally.
- [x] Create and run tasks — add `tasks.json` or npm scripts to build/test/run.
- [x] Launch the project — verify `npm start` or equivalent runs the app.
- [x] Ensure documentation is complete — update `README.md` with setup and run instructions.

## Quick tips

- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep messages concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices and prefer small, reversible changes.

> If you want me to apply any of the checklist items automatically (scaffolding files, adding scripts, or creating workflows), reply with **"Apply these fixes"** and I'll make the changes and report back.
