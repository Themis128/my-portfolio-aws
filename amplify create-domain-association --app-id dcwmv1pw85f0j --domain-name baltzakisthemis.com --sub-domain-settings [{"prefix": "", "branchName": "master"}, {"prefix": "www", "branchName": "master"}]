       [1m--cli-input-json [22m| [1m--cli-input-yaml [22m(string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       [1m--generate-cli-skeleton[22m. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with [1m--cli-input-yaml[22m.

       [1m--generate-cli-skeleton [22m(string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value [1minput[22m, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for [1m--cli-input-json[22m. Similarly, if provided [1myaml-input [22mit will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with [1m--cli-input-yaml[22m. If provided
       with the value [1moutput[22m, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command. The generated JSON skeleton is not
       stable  between versions of the AWS CLI and there are no backwards com-
       patibility guarantees in the JSON skeleton generated.

[1mGLOBAL OPTIONS[0m
       [1m--debug [22m(boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       [1m--no-verify-ssl [22m(boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       [1m--no-paginate [22m(boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       is provided.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       [1m--cli-read-timeout [22m(int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       [1m--cli-connect-timeout [22m(int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

       [1m--cli-binary-format [22m(string)

       The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is
       base64.  The  base64  format  expects  binary blobs to be provided as a
       base64 encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves  compati-
       bility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed liter-
       ally.  When  providing  contents  from a file that map to a binary blob
       [1mfileb:// [22mwill always be treated as binary and use the file contents di-
       rectly regardless of the [1mcli-binary-format [22msetting. When using  [1mfile://[0m
       the  file  contents  will need to properly formatted for the configured

                 REQUESTING_CERTIFICATE

              The certificate is in the process of being updated.
                 PENDING_VERIFICATION

              Indicates  that an Amplify managed certificate is in the process
              of being verified. This occurs during the creation of  a  custom
              domain  or when a custom domain is updated to use a managed cer-
              tificate.
                 IMPORTING_CUSTOM_CERTIFICATE

              Indicates that an Amplify custom certificate is in  the  process
              of  being  imported. This occurs during the creation of a custom
              domain or when a custom domain is updated to use a  custom  cer-
              tificate.
                 PENDING_DEPLOYMENT

              Indicates  that  the  subdomain or certificate changes are being
              propagated.
                 AWAITING_APP_CNAME

              Amplify is waiting for CNAME records corresponding to subdomains
              to be propagated. If your custom domain is on Route 53,  Amplify
              handles  this  for you automatically. For more information about

              The certificate has been associated with a domain.

              The  certificate has failed to be provisioned or associated, and
